Creating a quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This quiz tests on basic knowledge of Javascript, using Javascript to do so.

I gave up on this project near the end stage due to frustration and running out of time(I will be trying to fix it pass it's due date). 
It will successfully track your score and send it to the local storage, but will not display your score at the end of the quiz.
The table of the high scores is also messed up and I couldn't figure out how to fix it.
